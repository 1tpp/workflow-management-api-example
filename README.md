# Designing Workflow Management API
This repository serves as the foundation for diverse solutions, encompassing workflow management tools, approval applications, automated processes, and various internal tools. Virtually all management or administrative tasks can be conceptualized as sequences of requests and decisions. A request is made, seeking permission to perform an action or access a resource, and a subsequent decision is made, guided by predefined logic.

## Introduction to Workflow Management Database
A workflow management database is the repository where information pertaining to the status of a process is stored at any given point. This information reflects the progress of the process and indicates how it can proceed further. This aligns with the concept of a finite-state machine in computer science, outlining how resources can exist in a finite number of states, with defined actions transitioning them from one state to another.

### Relationship with Workflow Management
Workflow management involves executing a repeatable set of decisions determining the fate of a request. This encompasses the decisions themselves, their timing, and the individuals responsible for making them. The objective is to navigate the request through various stages based on established business rules. Examples include employee onboarding, purchase order handling, approval workflows, editorial processes for video tutorials, and other business operations. Effective workflow database design is paramount for the success of these applications.

For instance, the process of submitting a bug in an internal software system could involve the following stages:

1. User records a bug with an initial status of submitted.
2. Service desk checks if the report follows a specified template; those that don't are marked as declined.
3. If the request is in the correct form, it's assigned to a member of the development team and marked as pending.
4. As the development team starts work, the status changes to in-progress.
5. Upon completion, the status changes to resolved.
6. The original user is notified of the outcome.

The workflow is represented by how the status changes during each action, with transitions and actions defining the necessary steps for the resource to move to the next status.

### Understanding the Workflow Management Database
Before delving into designing a workflow management database, it's crucial to understand the abstract workings of the system. The chosen method here is based on a relational data model, consisting of various tables representing different data entities, interconnected through defined relationships.

#### Key Data Entities
The fundamental model includes data objects for:

- Requests: Subject to review, approval, or implementation by different actors.
- Processes: Governing the handling of each request.
- Request information: Variable data associated with each request.
- States: The statuses that individual requests can be in.
- Transitions and actions: The flow of states that users can progress requests through within a process, along with the controls governing this progression.
- Users: Individuals involved in the workflow.

While the nomenclature is flexible, the goal is to create a versatile data model applicable to a broad range of internal processes. This ensures the database can serve as the foundation for various internal tools and technical solutions. Defining the underlying business logic is imperative before formalizing it into a database structure supporting approval processes.
